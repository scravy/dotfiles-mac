# dot files for working on macOS

Usage:

	git clone git@github.com:scravy/dotfiles-mac.git ~/.dotfiles
	chmod u+x ~/.dotfiles/link.sh
	~/.dotfiles/link.sh ~/.dotfiles

The link script creates a symlink for every file in the dot-files repository,
i.e. `bashrc` in the repository will be linked to as `~/.bashrc`.
